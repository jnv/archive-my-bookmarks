# archive-my-bookmarks

A few utilities for archiving stuff from various bookmarking services.

While most services provide some export capabilities, sadly the provided data are usually incomplete. For example Instapaper and Diigo won't give you your highlights. Keeeb doesn't provide any export at all. Most services have API which gives you access to more data. In some cases, the API is, let's say, not official…

Expect some very rough and non-elegant code, as these are mostly one-off utilities to scratch my itch.

See individual folders for more details:
- [Instapaper](instapaper/) – Download all texts, including highlights and contents.
- Diigo (planned)
- Keeeb (planned)
- Pocket (planned)
